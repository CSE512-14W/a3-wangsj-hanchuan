## Project Name：Movie Explorer：Which movie to watch tonight?

The data domain for our visualization is a part of the movie.csv file from assignment 2, with correction of mistakes. We visualized movies produced from 2000-2010 for user do browse and compare according to different ordering and visual encodings so that they can pick up the movie they are interested in watching.

User can manually select the ordering of the movie data, as long as the volumes that the bar chart is representing above and below the X axis. So that they can browse the movie data according to their interests

## Changes between Storyboard and the Final Implementation:

The changes we applied to final visualization includes: 
Grouping the bar chart to 19 movies each and used average for ordering. Because there is a lot of movies and it is easier to browse them after grouping movie with similar sorting characteristics. 
Abandon the visual encoding of the C volume(the width if the bar chart), because a variable width of the bar chart will make it difficult to click and browse. 
Added Color encoding to the major genre, helping the user to filter out their favorite type of movie at first glance.

## Development Process

The visualization development started with brain storming ideas and finding proper data set. Inspired form the work in assignment 2, we decide on working on a interactive movie visualization tool to help user selecting movie of their interests. Then we designed the bar chart browsing system and implemented visualization. Finally we fixed minor bugs to make our interactive visualization more robust. The most time consuming parts are system design and webpage lay out adjustment. A total 39 hours are user and separated among teammates as follow.
